       <p class="mt-3"><b style="font-size: 20px;">Chandra Shekhar Tiwari </b> popularly known as Chandra Shekhar 
        Azad, was an Indian revolutionary who reorganised the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) under 
        its new name of Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) after the death of its founder, Ram Prasad Bismil, and three 
        other prominent party leaders, Roshan Singh, Rajendra Nath Lahiri and Ashfaqulla Khan.
        In 1921, when the Non-Cooperation Movement was at its height, Chandra Shekhar, then a 15-year-old 
        student, joined. As a result, he was arrested on 20 December. On being presented 
        before the Parsi district magistrate Justice M. P. Khareghat a week later, he gave 
        his name as <b>"Azad"</b> (The Free), his father's name as <b>"Swatantrata"</b> (Independence) and 
        his residence as <b>"Jail"</b>. The angered magistrate punished him with 15 lashes.</p>
      
        <h5><b><u>Death :-</u></b></h5>
         <p>On 27 February 1931, the CID head of the police at Allahabad, J. R. H. Nott-Bower was 
        tipped off by someone that 
        Azad was at Alfred Park and was having a talk with his companion and aide Sukhdev Raj.
        The police arrived at the park and surrounded it from all four sides. 
        The police fired back. After a long shootout, holding true to his pledge to<b> always 
        remain Azad (Free) and never be captured alive, he shot himself in the head with his 
        gun's last bullet</b>. 
        In the shootout, Bower and DSP Singh were injured in the right hand and jaws 
        respectively.</p>
